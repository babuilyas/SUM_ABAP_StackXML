# SUM_ABAP_StackXML
StackXML correction for ABAP systems

This small program can save plenty of time for BASIS guys who are facing differences with stack xml and underline ABAP system. System prompt following error during upgrade using SUM.

..... 
Component EA-FINSERV release 618 SP level 0001 from XML differs from 0011 in source system! 
Component EA-GLTRADE release 618 SP level 0001 from XML differs from 0011 in source system! 
Component EA-HR release 608 SP level 0021 from XML differs from 0058 in source system! 
.....

The program takes two inputs i.e.

Stack XML
Error messages
and generates new xml with correction.

Good luck.
